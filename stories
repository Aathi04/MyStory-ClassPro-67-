Once upon a time in a forests there lived a monkey who resided on a berry 
tree which was on the banks of the river. In the same forests, there lived 
a crocodile ...
One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the 
tree. The kind hearted monkey gave him some fruits. The crocodile came 
back  the next day for more fruits, as he loved them. As days passed by,
the crocodile and the monkey became very close friends.
One day the monkey sent some fruits to the crocodile's wife. She ate the fruits
and liked them but was jealous as she didn't like her husband spending time with 
the monkey. She told her husband, "if the fruits are soo juicy, i wonder how sweet
the monkey's heart would be. Get me the heart of the monkey".the crocodile was not
 willing to kill his friend but had no choice.
